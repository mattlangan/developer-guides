> The term "Microservice Architecture" has sprung up over the last few years to describe a particular way of designing software applications as suites of independently deployable services. While there is no precise definition of this architectural style, there are certain common characteristics around organization around business capability, automated deployment, intelligence in the endpoints, and decentralized control of languages and data.

> A **service-oriented architecture** (**SOA**) is a style of software design where services are provided to the other components by [application components](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_components), through a [communication protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_protocol) over a network. The basic principles of service-oriented architecture are independent of vendors, products and technologies.

> As core domain models grew and new features were introduced, our components became tightly coupled, and enforcing encapsulation made separation of concerns difficult. Continuous integration turned into a liability because deploying the codebase meant deploying everything at once. Our engineering team experienced rapid growth and scaling, which not only meant handling more requests but also handling a significant increase in developer activity. Adding new features, fixing bugs, and resolving technical debt all in a single [repo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_repository) became extremely difficult. Tribal knowledge was required before attempting to make a single change.
