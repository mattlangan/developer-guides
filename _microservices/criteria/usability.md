## Usability

Usability refers to the ability of other developers to use your microservice in their application(s). There are several key elements that go into making a microservice usable.

### API documentation

- Are all the methods and expected responses documented?
- Is there a clear quick-start guide for developers to test a basic integration with the microservice?

### Helpful error responses

- Do error messages indicate why a request failed and suggest a resolution path?

### Detailed commit history

- Does the commit history explain _why_ certain changes were made to the codebase to help future consumers and maintainers understand the reasoning behind changes?
