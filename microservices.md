# Microservices

A microservice refers to a self-contained piece of functionality that can be used by a separate application to perform a very specific task. This is similar to the Service-Oriented Architecture you may be familiar with in the Enterprise Service Bus (ESB), with the critical distinction that microservices are independently maintained, written, and deployed rather than being many components within the same stack.

Breaking microservices into their own environments comes with potential beneifts and drawbacks, which this guide seeks to help developers navigate as they consider employing such an approach in their work.
